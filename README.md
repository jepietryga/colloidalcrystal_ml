# What is this?
This is a tool for ImageSegmenting colloidal crystal SEM Images and building models out of them to automate counting & classification.

The main use of this repository is to access the ImageSegmenter class as it allows users to utilize different computer vision tools through classes and applets forp erfomring segmentation and labeling.

Additionally, code for helping train and utilize RandomForest classification models is also included.

# How to install
Use 
```
git clone https://github.com/jepietryga/colloidal_crystal_ML.git
```

or follow other methods with SSH or CLI!

After that, you may use the requirements.txt file inside a virtual environment to ensure you have the correct libraries.


# How to use

`facet_ml` holds the main body of code, which includes code for segmenters, models, and utility scripts for handling images as well as the applet code.

`Tutorials` holds notebook and script files that walkthrough usage of some of the code. This includes segmentation, classification, and data viewing.
